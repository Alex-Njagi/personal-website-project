        <h4>"Who is MARINA?"</h4>
        <p>Marina Lambrini Diamandis, known mononymously as Marina, and previously by the stage name Marina and the Diamonds, is a Welsh singer and songwriter.</p>

        <h4>"Where is she from and what music does she release?"</h4>
        <p>Born in Brynmawr to a Welsh mother and Greek father, Diamandis was raised in Abergavenny and moved to London as a teenager to become a professional singer, despite having little formal musical experience. In 2009, she came to prominence upon placing second in the BBC's Sound of 2010. Her debut studio album, The Family Jewels (2010), incorporated indie pop and new wave musical styles. It entered the UK Albums Chart at number five and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry. The album's second single, "Hollywood", peaked at number 12 on the UK Singles Chart. Her follow-up record, Electra Heart (2012), was a concept album about a character of the same name which became her first number one project in the United Kingdom. The album was certified gold in the US and UK, with its singles "Primadonna" and "How to Be a Heartbreaker" becoming international hits.
            Diamandis's synthpop-inspired third studio album, Froot (2015), became her third top 10 album in the UK and her first top 10 entry on the US Billboard 200, where it charted at number 8. Produced entirely by Diamandis and David Kosten, it was praised for its cohesive sound and introspective lyrical content. In 2018, she was featured on Clean Bandit's single "Baby", which reached the top 15 in the UK. Her fourth studio album, Love + Fear, was released on 26 April 2019. The album charted at number five on the UK album chart. She released her fifth studio album, Ancient Dreams in a Modern Land, on 11 June 2021 which debuted at number 17 in the UK. The deluxe version was released on 7 January 2022.</p>
