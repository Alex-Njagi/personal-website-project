        <h3>According to Wikipedia:</h3>
        <p>Love + Fear (stylised in all caps) is the fourth studio album by Welsh singer Marina Diamandis and her first under the mononym Marina. It was released in full on 26 April 2019 by Atlantic Records, though the album's first half was released on 4 April 2019 as a surprise. Diamandis took a hiatus after she concluded touring in support of her third studio album Froot (2015) with plans of retiring from music. However, she began working on a new record with several producers like Sam de Jong, Oscar GÃ¶rres, Joel Little, Jack Patterson, Mark Ralph, James Flannigan, and Oscar Holter during its recording.</p>
        <p>The "Froot of the Month" campaign saw six songs ("Froot", "Happy", "Immortal", "I'm a Ruin", "Forget" and "Gold") released on a monthly basis in anticipation of the record. Froot has been promoted through a series of festival performances during the spring and summer; Diamandis toured internationally with the accompanying Neon Nature Tour, with performances scheduled in North America, Europe and South America between October 2015 and March 2016.</p>
        <p>The album was supported by four singles, all of which were supplemented by music videos: "Handmade Heaven", "Superstar", "Orange Trees", "To Be Human", and "Karma".[1][2] It also includes the previously released single "Baby" (2018) with Clean Bandit. The album was announced alongside a tour, which visited the US, Canada, and Europe, which began in April 2019 and concluded in November.[3] An acoustic EP, titled Love + Fear (Acoustic), was released on 13 September 2019.[4]</p>
